TASK 6: Quantum Error Correction (9-Qubit Code)

Aim:
To demonstrate logical qubit encoding and error protection using the 9-qubit Shor code.
Algorithm:
•	Encode logical |0⟩ and |1⟩ into 9-qubit states.
•	Simulate bit-flip noise on the encoded qubits.
•	Demonstrate noise resilience.
•	Output encoded and noisy states.
